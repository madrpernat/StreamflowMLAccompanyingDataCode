Accompanying code and data for paper: The Relative Importance of Model Structure and Input Features for Water Supply Forecasting in Snow-Dominated River Basins of the US Southwest

The only incosistency between this code/data and the paper is the numbering of the SNOTEL stations. In the paper, SNOTEL station numbering "Study ID" starts from 1, while here the numbering starts from 0. As an example, in the paper, the Lone Cone station for the Animas River basin has a study ID of 4, but in the Animas_River_data.csv file, the Lone Cone station is station 3.

Feature and streamflow data were gathered from several different sources. Seasonal streamflow volumes were obtained from the US Geological Survey streamflow gages (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw). Snow water equivalent and precipitation accumulation observations were obtained from the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) database (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/data-and-reports/snow-and-water-interactive-map). Temperature, specific humidity, and windspeed data were obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?keywords=NLDAS). Southern Oscillation Index data were obtained from the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center (https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data were obtained from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/pdo/). Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation data were obtained from NOAA’s Physical Science Laboratory (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/timeseries/AMO/). North Atlantic Oscillation data were obtained from NCAR’s Climate Guide (https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/hurrell-north-atlantic-oscillation-nao-index-pc-based).
